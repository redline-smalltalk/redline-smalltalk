Boostrapping:
=============

The following classes make up the minimum set of classes required to bootstrap Redline Smalltalk to a point where
development is possible:

  Object, Behavior, ClassDescription, Class, Metaclass, UndefinedObject, Boolean, True, False, Collection,
  SequenceableCollection, ArrayedCollection, String, Symbol.


Source Code Formatting Guidelines:
==================================

0. The default indent size is two spaces. We are using spaces not tabs.

1. Start the source file with the Copyright comment and a blank line.
   "Redline Smalltalk, Copyright (c) James C. Ladd. All rights reserved. See LICENSE in the root of this distribution."
   <blankline>

2. Define the method categories with a comment and a blank line.
   <blankline>
   "accessing"
   <blankline>

3. Leave a space between the short-hand instance/class method definition character '-/+' and the method selector.
   The method definition character should be in column 0 (left most place).
   - at: key put: value

4. Put any method documentation comment next, indented two spaces (from column 0).
   - at: key put: value
     "method documentation comment here"

5. Always leave a space before and after a binary selector.
   ^ self.
   this + that.

6. Blocks should look close to this, although it is also fine for simple blocks to be on one line.

   (condition) ifTrue: [ :arg |
     "complex block"
   ].

   (condition) ifFalse: [ "simple block ].

7. While a period to end a statement is not always required, always add one to assist those new to Smalltalk.
   ^ self.

*end*
